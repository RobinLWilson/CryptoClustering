# CryptoClustering
Module 19

This challenge uses unsupervised learning to predict is cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

The data was first analyzed by using the StandardScaler to normalize the data.  I then found a k-value of 4 and clustered the data into 4 groups.

Then I analyzed the data by using the PCA model and still found that the optimal k was 4.  However this did not significantly change the clusters, so I adjusted to using a k=3.  When I made centroids of 3, the distribution of the clusters were improved by the increased number of data points given to those clusters.
